Rotate String without changing the index of Special Characters

Very Favourite Question to Interviewers for Technical Interviews

I've checked 
if there is any element other than Number or Alphabets and added that index, element (key,value) into dictionary.
else concat the rest of the characters as a string, Now you can do what ever operation although here its reverse.
atlast insert(index, value) to the modified string
print using join function
